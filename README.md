# mdbutton
Dokuwiki markdown editor button
Adds Toolbar button to add code tag for markdown.  This is a copy of the CodeButton extension by Heiko Barth, just slightly modified.  

See Heiko Barth's original project - https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:codebutton

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
https://github.com/w3bservice/mdbutton

Install using the Extension Manager.  Admin button -> Extension Manager -> Search and Install tab -> Search "mdbutton" -> Select "install"

You should then see a new bash icon in your editor toolbar when editing wiki pages.  Selecting this button will add the <code bash> and </code> tags.

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/mdbutton/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
